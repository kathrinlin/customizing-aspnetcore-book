## Becoming a software developer

Juergen was born in Summer 1978 in Paderborn (Germany) and grew up in southern Germany near Singen, which is near the Swiss boarder and the Lake of Constance (around an hour away from Zurich, Switzerland). Swiss and Switzerland was always a part of his life, also because his aunt married a guy from Bern and vacations in the Swiss Alps got pretty common. 

During his childhood, Juergen never had the idea to become a software developer, even if he liked technique and science. His idea was to become a fashion designer or product designer. His dream was to work for a fashion label or as a product designer for a car company like BMW. Since he wasn't that good in school, he need to use another way to go to a design university. In November 2001 he started to work as a web designer for a small company. He designed web sites and put the designs directly into ASP templates for a CMS system built and hosted by that company. 

Some day the boss told him that his designs where shitty, but his programming skills where quite good and he should start working as a software developer to maintain and enhance the CMS. This was kinda shocking, but at the end he accepted, because programming also was kinda fun. Anyway. He started a education as software application developer and learned the software project business as well as the product development business. 

In 2002 he started working with ASP.NET 1.0. He helped to move the ASP and VB6 based CMS to ASP.NET 1.0, ASP.NET 1.1 and ASP.NET 2.0. His education ended in summer 2004. In January 2007 he changed the company to work as an ASP.NET expert for a company in Constance that tried to introduce a web based CRM system as an addition to the fat client. Later he became the project and team lead for the web CRM and also introduced the Team Foundation Server to this company. 

In summer 2010 he again changed the job and moved to a company that creates a software to optimize service processes. They provided a web, desktop and mobile application for service technicians and job order managers. Actually this software was an API between human and SAP. He became the development lead in this company, optimized the development and DevOps process using the Team Foundation Server. 

He quit this job one year and three months later, because he got two project offers at the same time, which where big enough to employ two additional developers. Because he quit and his current employer needed his skills, he got the development lead in this company as a third project offer. So he started his own company in October 2011, with two additional software developers and a person for the administrative stuff. 

But a company only works with paying customer. Since one customer wasn't able to pay some open bills, he needed to shut down his company end of March 2013. Luckily one customer employed him to finish a project he just started. His very first Azure project. Since than he is working for the YooApplications AG in Basel (Switzerland) which is now known as YOO AG.

## Juergen vs. Jürgen

Both is absolutely correct. Actually his name is Jürgen, but writing (or reading) umlauts in other than German speaking countries may be hard. This is why he is used to write Juergen in English texts. In German UE is the replacement for Ü, as well as AE is the replacement for Ä and OE for Ö. So both is fine :-)

Pronunciation is another story: 

**Juergen**: Yurgen, while the first vowel is almost similar to the U in "urgent", the G should be spelled as in "get". (Actually not but this may be easier for English speaking people.) **Gutsch**: This may be easier. The G as in "get" and the rest is "ootch" with a short vowel.  So try to pronounce it like this: **Yurgen Gootch**. Actually the pronunciation of Juergen is also hard for German speaking folks.

Actually the Microsoft ASP.NET program manager Jeff Fritz (CSharpFritz) is pronouncing my name pretty well. He also heard some ugly pronunciation like Gurgen Gutsh, where all the Gs are like in "gentleman" and the U like in "but"

## Developer community work

His developer community experience started in 2001 with the German Flash forum and little later in the German ASP forum. He got pretty active on the ASP forum and became a moderator later on. The former MVP Stefan Falz was leading that forum and changed it later to the Community Server and rebranded his forum to ASP.NET Zone in 2007. Since than every moderator got a blog on that system. At this time his blogging experience started, together with his Twitter experience. Not only developers where reading his blog posts, but also magazine editors. So he got asked to write for German speaking developer magazines. And started to talk on conferences and user groups. 

He started leading a cross border .NET user group for developer in his region of Germany and Switzerland. Together with the other user group leads, he hosted two developer community conferences in Kreuzlingen (Switzerland)

Since November 2015 he is blogging in English, which increased the amount of readers and the reach a lot, as well as the visibility in the global developer community.

And today? He is leading the INETA Germany, as well as a .NET user group in Basel and is still blogging on https://asp.net-hacker.rocks. He is also still writing for German .NET Magazines and presenting talks on developer conferences and developer user groups.

Because of that work, he got awarded for four time for the Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies.
